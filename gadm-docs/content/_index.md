# 👋 Welcome

This project is a REST API for exploring the [GADM](https://gadm.org/) dataset 🌍 — a global collection of administrative boundaries (countries, regions, provinces, districts, and so on).

The API makes it super easy to work with GADM data in the formats you actually need:

📦 Get boundaries as a GeoJSON FeatureCollection (great for maps + visualizations)

📄 Stream data as newline-delimited GeoJSON (GeoJSONL) (perfect for big data pipelines)

🎯 Use reverse geocoding to find the smallest GADM level for any given point (like “which province is this coordinate in?”)

Built with Go (Golang)⚡, the server is fast, reliable, and designed to handle large geospatial datasets without breaking a sweat.

If you’re building mapping tools, spatial analysis workflows, or just want quick access to administrative boundaries, this API gives you a simple, programmatic way to plug GADM data into your projects 🚀.
